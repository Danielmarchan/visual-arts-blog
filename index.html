            With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned
            their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that
            established them as a truly great husband and wife design team.
            Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture.
            Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated
            and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".
            </p>

                That look and their relationship with Herman Miller
                started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s
                and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair,
                now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York
            </p>
            <p>
                Charles and Ray achieved their monumental
                success by approaching each project the same way:
                Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?

                The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture,
                process and product, style and function. "The details are not details", said Charles.
                "They make the product".

                Their own concepts evloved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of
                the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".
            </p>

                A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place".
                That they did. That also made it a lot more interesting.
